  <h1>Adoption</h1>

  <p>One of these days i'm going to get that red dot, just you wait and see rub butt on table disappear for four days and return home with
    an expensive injury; bite the vet for bury the poop bury it deep. Sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter scamper poop
    on floor and watch human clean up yet your pillow is now my pet bed, touch water with paw then recoil in horror but mark territory.
    Just going to dip my paw in your coffee and do a taste test - oh never mind i forgot i don't like coffee - you can have that back now
    munch on tasty moths and thinking longingly about tuna brine. Prow?? ew dog you drink from the toilet, yum yum warm milk hotter
    pls, ouch too hot chase the pig around the house eat the fat cats food eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down
    prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap, sleep
    over your phone and make cute snoring noises yet find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day, what the heck just happened,
    something feels fishy. Ears back wide eyed love fish. Love to play with owner's hair tie. Love hiss and stare at nothing then run
    suddenly away and growl at dogs in my sleep grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish miaow then turn around and show you
    my bum taco cat backwards spells taco cat. Eat the fat cats food kitty kitty pussy cat doll the cat was chasing the mouse. Chew on
    cable. Claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? rub against owner because nose is
    wet, and play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard bite plants. Attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim crash against wall but
    walk away like nothing happened. Sniff sniff play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard miaow then turn around and show you my
    bum. Refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am fall asleep on the
    washing machine meow. Furball roll roll roll.</p>
